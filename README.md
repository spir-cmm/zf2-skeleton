You must edit the `Vagrantfile` to edit the ip address you want to set for the vm.
find the `config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"` config line and
set the ip address you want to use in your own private network.
Eventually comment unused chef cookbook recipe and run :

`vagrant up`
